Every day we have 10:30 trivia.
We tune into Classical KDFC and Ray White lists off 3 events that all took place on the same year that the piece of music they play, was written. We write our guesses on a post-it note and wait in suspense to hear the answer. We tally up scores (number of years you were off from the actual year) and track them for the whole month. Whoever has the lowest score at the end of the month, wins!

While we've become pretty good at the 1700s - 1950s (time period most classical music was written), we've often wished for a broader range which could provide bigger upsets and would really change the game.
So I started looking into the Wikipedia API to see if I could find a way to randomly generate a set of clues that all took place on the same year. 

This is what I came up with :)
